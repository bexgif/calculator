# calculator

This project is a simple yet stylish calculator application developed using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator features a sleek user interface with basic arithmetic operations, memory functionality, and a calculation history display.

### Overview
The Stylish Calculator is designed to offer an intuitive and visually appealing way to perform calculations. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with advanced functions like square root, exponentiation, and percentage calculations. The application also includes memory functions (M+, M-, MR) to store and recall values, and a backspace button for correcting input mistakes.

### Features
The calculator provides the following functionalities:

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Advanced Functions: Includes square root, exponentiation, and percentage calculations.
Memory Functions:
M+: Adds the current display value to memory.
M-: Subtracts the current display value from memory.
MR: Recalls the value stored in memory.
Calculation History: Keeps track of previous calculations, allowing the user to see recent results.
User-Friendly Interface: Stylish design with clearly labeled buttons, a large display, and responsive button behavior.
Backspace and Clear Functions: Provides options to delete the last input or clear the entire display.

### Technologies Used
The calculator is built using:

Python 3
Tkinter (Python's standard GUI library)

### How to Run the Application

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from python.org.

Running the Calculator:
Download or clone the repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder containing the script.
Run the script with the command: python calculator.py (or python3 calculator.py depending on your system).
The calculator window will appear, and you can start using it immediately.

### How to Use the Calculator
Basic Usage:
Click the numeric and operator buttons to form mathematical expressions.
Use the "=" button to evaluate the expression.

Advanced Operations:
Use the "√" button for square roots and the "^" button for exponentiation.
The "%" button can be used to calculate percentages.

Memory Functions:
Press M+ to add the current display value to memory.
Press M- to subtract the current display value from memory.
Use MR to recall the memory value.

Editing Input:
Click the "←" button to delete the last digit.
Press the "C" button to clear the entire display.

### Project Structure
calculator.py: The main script that contains all the code for the calculator's functionality.

### Conclusion
This Stylish Calculator project is a great way to get familiar with building graphical user interfaces in Python using Tkinter. It showcases various features like button handling, memory operations, and handling of mathematical calculations in a user-friendly interface.
